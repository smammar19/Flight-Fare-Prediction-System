# Flight Fare Prediction
This project is a web application designed to predict flight fares using machine learning algorithms. It employs Flask, a Python web framework, to provide users with a seamless experience in estimating flight costs based on various parameters. Leveraging a combination of data preprocessing techniques, model training, and prediction algorithms, the application aims to deliver accurate fare estimates tailored to individual user inputs.

## Features
1. User-friendly Interface: The web interface allows users to input flight details easily and obtain fare predictions.
2. Accurate Predictions: Utilizing machine learning models, the application generates precise estimates for flight fares.
3. Flexible Inputs: Users can input a range of parameters such as departure city, destination, date, airline preferences, and more.
4. Real-time Updates: The application adapts to changes in input parameters, providing updated fare estimates accordingly.
5. Responsive Design: The interface is optimized for various devices, ensuring accessibility across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-fare-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd flight-fare-prediction
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Ensure you have the necessary data files (e.g., flight data CSV) available or set up the data source as required.

## Usage
1. Run the Flask application: python app.py
2. Access the application through your web browser at http://localhost:5000.
3. Input the flight details (departure city, destination, date, etc.) into the provided form.
4. Click on the "Predict" button to obtain the estimated flight fare.
5. The application will display the predicted fare based on the provided inputs.
